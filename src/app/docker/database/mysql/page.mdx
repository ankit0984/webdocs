3. Environment Variable Configuration – Supports easy configuration of root user, database creation, and user credentials via environment variables.
4. Cross-Platform Compatibility – Works seamlessly across Linux, macOS, and Windows environments.
5. Data Persistence – Comes preconfigured with volume mounting for persistent storage of MySQL data.
6. Community & Enterprise Support – Backed by VMware and trusted in enterprise-grade environments.
7. Lightweight & Secure – Optimized with minimal vulnerabilities compared to unofficial images.
