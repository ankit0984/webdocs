# Bitnami Redis Setup with Docker Compose

This guide demonstrates how to run **Bitnami Redis** using Docker Compose.
The Bitnami image is production-ready, secure by default, and easy to configure.

## Why use bitnami Redis?:
Bitnami provides pre-packaged and well-maintained container images that are widely trusted in the industry.
Here are some key advantages of using the Bitnami Redis Docker image over other Redis images:

1. Production-Ready – Bitnami’s images are hardened for security and optimized for performance.
2. Regular Updates – Images are frequently updated to include security patches and the latest versions of Redis.
3. Environment Variable Configuration – Supports easy configuration of root user, database creation, and user credentials via environment variables.
4. Cross-Platform Compatibility – Works seamlessly across Linux, macOS, and Windows environments.
5. Data Persistence – Comes preconfigured with volume mounting for persistent storage of Redis data.
6. Community & Enterprise Support – Backed by VMware and trusted in enterprise-grade environments.
7. Lightweight & Secure – Optimized with minimal vulnerabilities compared to unofficial images.

## Container file
`docker.compose.yml` file for creating Redis docker image

```yaml filename="docker.compose.yaml"
version: "3.0.1"

services:
  redis:
    container_name: redis
    image: "docker.io/bitnami/redis:latest"
    environment:
      - REDIS_PASSWORD=${REDIS_PASSWORD}
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=no
      - REDIS_DISABLE_COMMANDS=FLUSHDB,FLUSHALL
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
