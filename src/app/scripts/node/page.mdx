## Node.js Installation Script (Linux with NVM)

Instead of copy-pasting commands one by one, you can save the following script as `install-node.sh` and run it directly.


```bash filename="install-node.sh"
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Exit on error
set -e

echo "📥 Installing NVM..."
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash

echo "🔄 Loading NVM..."
\. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"

echo "📦 Installing Node.js v22..."
nvm install 22

echo "✅ Verifying installation..."
echo "Node.js version: $(node -v)"
echo "NVM current: $(nvm current)"
echo "npm version: $(npm -v)"

echo "installing yarn"
# Download and install Yarn:
corepack enable yarn
# Verify Yarn version:
yarn -v

echo "🎉 Installation complete!"
```

## ▶️ How to Use
 1. Save the script above as install-node.sh.
 2. Give it execution permission:
```bash
chmod +x install-node.sh
```

## Install yarn
* If `corepack enable yarn` fails then try `sudo npm i -g yarn` or `sudo apt install yarn`
